TODO:

- bug when toggling the original image? extra frame/border appears and the x/back disappears
- update readme
- calculate exact sizes for frames etc. and adjust fonts appropriately
- better app icon
- figure out best way to include pictures. subcategories? maximum that the app can be bundled with?

QUESTIONS:
- tapping an image from the collectionview add 4mb to the memory for each image. why??
- Why does the photo library take so long to load the first time?



LATER:
- figure out why the preview image does not quite line up with the image that is being solved. whatever pieces are in the correct position look a pixel or two off when the preview is toggled on and off
- add ability to flip/rotate entire game board
- add languages to settings page
- sound effects

- potential crash when turning off access to camera in the device's settings app



- enable for iOS 7. see these posts about the errors that pop up when switching the build settings.  (Target -> Build Settings -> iOS Deployment Target ->  iOS 8.0)
- would need to change the UIAlertViews
