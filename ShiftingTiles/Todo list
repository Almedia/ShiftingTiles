TODO:
- retake sample images for the rules page 1
- check on all devices in simulator



QUESTIONS:
- tapping an image from the collectionview add 4mb to the memory for each image. why??
- Why does the photo library take so long to load the first time?



LATER:
- figure out why the preview image does not quite line up with the image that is being solved. whatever pieces are in the correct position look a pixel or two off when the preview is toggled on and off
- add ability to flip/rotate entire game board
- add languages to settings page
- sound effects
