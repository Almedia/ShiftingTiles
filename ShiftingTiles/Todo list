Questions

- Why does the photo library take so long to load the first time?



LATER
- add draggability to tiles. tap and drag to move that tile around. wherever the tap is let go, grab that tile and swap
- could make the selected tile grow in size slightly to indicate it was tapped. instead of the black border
- add ability to flip/rotate entire game board
