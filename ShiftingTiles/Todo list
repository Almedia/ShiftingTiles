Todo:
- add languages to settings page
- fix image picker with brads fix
- rotation gesture instead of long tap?

- how to do the outlets on the various nib files (example is the label on the first rules page - i want to be able to change the text color)

- page control for the info rules page
onboardpageviewcontroller (hacker missioin example)


Questions

- tapping an image from the collectionview add 4mb to the memory for each image. why??
- Why does the photo library take so long to load the first time?
- What is the best game design? Allow users to choose whether shuffles AND rotations are on/off?
this leads to a problem when both are turned off....



LATER
- add draggability to tiles. tap and drag to move that tile around. wherever the tap is let go, grab that tile and swap
- could make the selected tile grow in size slightly to indicate it was tapped. instead of the black border
- add ability to flip/rotate entire game board
